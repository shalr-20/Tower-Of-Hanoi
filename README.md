# **Tower Of Hanoi**

The Tower of Hanoi is a classical problem in computer science and mathematics that involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, subject to the constraint that only one disk can be moved at a time and a disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty peg.

This Java program provides a solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem using a recursive algorithm. The number of disks and the names of the source, helper, and destination pegs are input by the user. The program then prints the sequence of steps to move the disks from the source peg to the destination peg.

## **Features**
**Input:** Users can provide number of disks, Source string, Helper string, and Destination string as input.

**Output:** Users will get the steps of how Tower of Hanoi will be solved as output.

# **Getting Started**

## **Prerequisites**
* BlueJ: It is an integrated development environment for the Java programming language, developed mainly for educational purposes, but also suitable for small-scale software development. It runs with the help of Java Development Kit. You can download BlueJ from the official website: https://bluej.org/.

* VS Code: You can also run this application on VS Code. To download VS Code along with the java extension, visit its official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java.

## **Installation**
* Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
* Extract the files to your desired directory.

## **Usage**
* Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
* Download the TowerOfHanoi.java file and save it to your desired directory.
* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the TowerOfHanoi.java file is located.
* Compile the Java file using command :javac TowerOfHanoi.java

## **Contributing**

The program uses a recursive approach to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem efficiently. Ensure valid input for the number of disks (a positive integer) is provided. Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from the code! If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
